h1. Quick Start Guide

These instructions were made on Windows but they should be similar on other platforms.

Start by installing Ruby 1.8.7
    Windows: Make sure you allow the binaries to be added to your PATH
	
Open a new command prompt and install a few necessary gems:
    gem install bundler
    gem install nokogiri -v 1.5.11
    gem install log4r

Locate your installation of SourceGear Vault Client.
    Commonly found in C:\Program Files (x86)\SourceGear\Vault Client
                      C:\Program Files (x86)\SourceGear\VaultPro Client

You can edit the options.rb file to set this value if it differs from the default. It's not necessary but saves you from having to include on the command line every time.

Create your folder structure for where you want your new git repository to be created.

Invoke the vault2git script like so:

<code>
ruby vault2git.rb --host VAULT_SERVER --repo VAULT_REPOSITORY_NANE -u VAULT_USER -p VAULT_PASSWORD VAULT_SOURCE GIT_DESTINATION
ruby vault2git.rb --host localhost --repo "Initial Repository" -u user -p password $/Apps/Alpha C:\source\git\Alpha
</code>

Make sure to put quotes around any parameters containing a space.

You might need some additional clean up steps to remove the Vault bindings from your projects. For example, Visual Studio embeds Vault source control information in solutions and project files.
